Increasingly, product and service brands are waking up to the importance of involving multiple senses in their offerings. Chris Thoen, head of Global Science and Technology at Givaudan, the Swiss-based company that’s the largest flavor and fragrance house in the world, makes the analogy to the evolution of the television: From two-dimensional TV in black and white, to color, then surround sound, and HDTV, each step representing a new or different way of engaging our senses. In the future, the “smellovision” experiment from the 1960s could resurface with scents related to a movie or TV show, emitted in a room to complement the storyline.

Many food, beverage, health and beauty aide, retail, furniture and hotel brands have come to the realization that smell, taste, sound, feel, texture, visual image and packaging all combine in the brain to create indelible impressions and enhance experiences. Optimizing them can lead to a “wow” reaction and make the product, service, hotel or store memorable, buzz-worthy and stand out at the point of purchase. Involving more of the senses can also heighten after-purchase satisfaction. Some hotels and retailers have proprietary scents that let guests know they’re at familiar places to stay and shop, or put them in the mood for purchasing a category, as in the case of coconut-scented swim-wear departments, or baby powder scent in infant clothing departments.

Thoen also uses the example of potato chips to help us understand the multi-sensory experience trend. Not only the taste, but also the visual appearance, smell, feel in the hand and mouth, and sound when broken or bit into, are all important. Finally, Thoen likened multi-sensory experiences to a symphony, where all elements, including instruments, acoustics, environment and level of skill, contribute to the experience and must play in balance and relation to each other.

To keep up on multi-sensory trends and offer the latest to their customers, Givaudan engages in a number of innovative sensory benchmarking activities:

- Special Chef’s Councils in cities whose chefs are contributing to innovation in the food and restaurant scene. Most recently hosted in Hong Kong and New York, these events are a starting point for flavor innovation. At the Chef's Council in New York, both perfumers and flavorists explored the new consumer trend of "freshness" to inspire their creations. Givaudan collaborates with external innovation partners, including ingredient companies, suppliers, universities and small start-ups with the intension to develop new business models, processes, and explore new technologies, like 3-D printing.
- Various types of Treks that support the in-depth discovery of ingredients including:
- Taste Treks to discover new coffee bean types and ways of roasting
- A special TasteTrek Citrus to University of California-Riverside’s unique citrus grove that has two of every type of citrus tree found in the world, to discover new scents for clients
- A CulinaryTrek focussed on how people in homes in Asia make noodle soups
- TasteTreks and TrendTreks in remote areas of China and Africa and rainforests, to see how indigenous people, not exposed to processed foods, achieve different food effects using only natural means
- BarTreks to see how particularly creative mixologists combine flavors, temperature, texture, mouth feel and presentation, to better understand beverage trends
- Visits with artists, craftsmen and scientists to cross-pollinate and inspire ideas for both new fragrances and flavors
- Fragrance collaboration and co-creation with next generation fashion designers at The Hyères International Festival of Fashion and Photography

Here’s a short list of some of the more exciting examples of the multi-sensory innovations combined into products across industries.

**Beverage**

Christophe Michalak, the 3-Michelin-Star Parisian dessert chef, created his “Magik Potion” drink that is a drinkable yogurt made of coconut milk with tapioca pearls and mango puree.

**Restaurant**

Barley Swine in Austin, Texas, has a 12-course tasting menu, in which each dish is a multi-sensory experience. A favorite dish combines a silky smoked pork custard, with sliced pig face (akin to thin Canadian Bacon and slightly chewy), and crunchy pork cracklings. Not only do you revel in the mix of flavors, but also the mouth feel and crunch of each element inside your mouth.

**Furniture**

Texture is a basis for innovation in this chair and ottoman, displayed at Milan’s furniture fair. While most chair surfaces are flat, here the bumpy, foam-like texture adds a cushioning effect that’s both comfortable and unique looking.

**Apparel Accessories**

Christian Louboutin, one of the most innovative shoe and handbag designers in the world, used a bumpy texture to differentiate his 2013 handbag and shoe line.

**Retail**

At Abercrombie & Fitch, the exterior of the store can be scented as well as the interior, and the paper the clothing is wrapped in to take home is also scented to subliminally remind customers of the store when they get home and unwrap their purchases.

**Hotels**

The Imperial Hotel in New Delhi, India smells of jasmine. Even the hotel’s shuttle van smells of Jasmine.

**Health And Beauty Aide**

Soaps with texture and oatmeal inclusions sold in health food stores provide a scruffing, loofah-like effect on the skin.

**Nine Steps To Develop More Multi-Sensory Innovation In Products And** **Services**

Here are some steps firms can take:

- Make multi-sensory innovation part of the routine brainstorming process. Devote time to each of the five senses. Ferran Adrià, widely considered the most innovative chef in the world (his restaurant El Bulli was five times selected #1 in the world in the San Pelegrino annual survey), even brainstormed a sixth sense (irony or nostalgia to evoke emotions from the eating experience).
- More and more companies have “Open Innovation” departments. Make multi-sensory innovation one of the key areas they look for.
- Work with flavor and fragrance suppliers who are experts, and who since they work across many different industries, are particularly good at cross-pollinating ideas.
- Collaborate with artists for better & more imaginative visual impact. French pastry chef Pierre Hermé does this. Aside from offering artistic looking pastries, his packaging has won global awards.
- Challenge packaging suppliers to experiment with different looks, orientations and materials for greater visual impact on the shelf and in the home.
- Tap into resources like Material ConneXion in the U.S. and other countries, and Matério in Paris, France, to utilize existing materials in new ways for packaging, or identify newly developed materials, that could be appropriate.
- Assign individuals in the firm to benchmark other industries for multi-sensory innovation ideas, through focused treks like the type Givaudan offers, or broader inspiration programs, like [Inventours](http://inventours.com/).
- Task employees throughout the firm with taking photos via Instagram or Pinterest of multi-sensory innovation they see around them. Capture the most inspiring examples and categorize them with hashtags so they can be searched easily when needed.
- Explore global, cross-industry, multi-sensory examples in the book *[Catalyzing Innovation](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/catalyzing-innovation/id794016507?mt=13)* chapters on multi-sensory innovation, ingredient innovation, presentation innovation, orientation innovation, asymmetry innovation, analogies innovation, and materials innovation.
