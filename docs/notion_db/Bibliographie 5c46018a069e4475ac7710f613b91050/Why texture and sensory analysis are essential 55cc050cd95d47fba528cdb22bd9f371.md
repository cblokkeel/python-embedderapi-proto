Texture is key. Responsible for triggering different sensations and reactions, texture is truly the charm card, the major contributor to consumer seduction.

The initial impression of the texture is what influences consumers’ choice of personal care products. The long-term appreciation upon use is what makes the consumer faithful to a cosmetic product.

The texture also plays a significant role in the perception of efficacy. Finally, it can also actively contribute to increase skin benefit, with so-called smart textures that possess inner biological activity, for example moisturising properties.

### The role of sensory analysis in cosmetics

As sensory impression plays an important role in the consumer’s purchase behavior, it is essential to be able to identify and describe the sensory properties of a cosmetic product.

Sensory analysis is a scientific discipline used to measure, analyse and interpret the characteristics of a product as they are perceived by the five senses.

It is helpful during the formulation step to evaluate the influence of a raw material, choose between several formulas, compare a formula with a referent product or fit with a marketing brief. It allows to obtain a full sensory profile of a cosmetic product, a kind of sensory identity card.

### Sensory analysis at Gattefossé

Gattefossé attaches great importance to the sensorial evaluation of its products and formulas and has been developing its expertise in sensory analysis since 1996.

Gattefossé created its own group of trained panelists, composed of a dozen experts, using analytical methods to sensorially characterise the products with precision and reproducibility. They follow a specific protocol and a standardised procedure and apply a statistical interpretation.

They can accurately assess the physical and sensorial properties of any product and translate these impressions into objective data, regardless of whether they are evaluating our own formulas or other products on the market.

At Gattefossé, sensory analysis is used to evaluate the influence of raw materials in a formula, determine the main sensory characteristics of our emulsifiers and texturising agents, compare a prototype with another or a benchmark, understand market preferences and constitute an internal texture database.

The products are evaluated following specific steps and criteria. It starts with a visual evaluation, before measuring the behavior of the product at first touch, then during application and finally, after absorption. Here are how these criteria are evaluated by these trained panelists:

**First touch:**

**During application:**

**After absorption:**

This expertise in sensory analysis also enabled Gattefossé to go further in understanding the influence of climate or the impact of layering on sensory perception.
