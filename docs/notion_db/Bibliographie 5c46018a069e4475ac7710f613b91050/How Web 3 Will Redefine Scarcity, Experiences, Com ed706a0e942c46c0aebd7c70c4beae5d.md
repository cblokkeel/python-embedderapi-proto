A Reconciliation of Luxury and Digital How Web 3 Will Redefine Scarcity, Experiences, Communities and Culture

Authors: Joel Hazan, Sarah Willersdorf, Filippo Bianchi, Jessica Apotheker, Nicolas de Bellefonds, Pierre-Francois Marteau For years, digital and luxury have had a love-hate relationship. Online channels accelerated during the pandemic with both increased ease of transactions and new ways to inspire consumers. Online purchases represented 20-25% of luxury sales in 2021, up from 10-15% in 2019. The share is expected to reach 30% by 2025. When it comes to inspiration, 80% of the luxury purchase journey is already digitally influenced in some way. Yet, luxury brands have never truly managed to get a grasp on Web 2.0, which was inherently opposed to what luxury always stood for: abundance, lack of differentiation and personal data exploitation. Now, with Web3, comes a new generation of internet. As with every new manifestation of technology, Web3 is generating diverse reactions amongst luxury executives. Some are willing to test and learn (e.g., Balenciaga, Gucci, D&G). Some are opportunists. Some are still skeptical, or at least cautious (e.g., Hermès), while few luxury brands or groups have started to sift through the risks and opportunities to identify the use cases that can be most adapted to their current needs (e.g., LVMH). Beyond the short-term reactions, one should think about the key concepts differentiating Web3 from Web 2.0: Blockchain, NFTs and Metaverse.

- Blockchain is about privacy, authenticity, and scarcity. - NFTs are about demonstrating wealth, taste, access and belonging to a community. - Cryptocurrencies are a new concentration of ready-to-use financial capital. - Metaverse is about playful, immersive, distinctive and (typically) synchronous experiences.

How can this not be a wonderful playing field for luxury companies to finally express their uniqueness and differentiation in the digital world, as more and more of our life becomes digital? Of course, what we are seeing today is still far from the long-term vision. The Fashion Week on proto- metaverse platform Decentraland came with rudimentary visuals, which were limited by today’s infrastructure. Certainly, the technology will need to evolve to allow brands to express their sophistication. It won’t happen instantly, but it will happen. Demographics are also pointing towards a greater future: GenZ and Gen Alpha are actively engaged with proto-metaverse platforms – these generations already spend significant time playing, socializing, and shopping there. Unlike Web 2.0, there is an early fit between luxury and Web3, pushing luxury brands to act faster than a few years ago. However, this early fit comes with two long-term risks. First, Web3 challenges the cultural relevance of luxury brands, which could be replaced at the apex of this new economy by Web3-relevant brands (e.g., Nike, already selling NFT in the tens of thousands dollars through RTKFT) or newly created exclusive communities (Bored Apes Yacht Club, Cryptopunks – both owned by Yuga Labs, which just announced that they are working on a metaverse)

Second, Web3 puts much more emphasis on experiences than products (either physical or digital). In a world where brands can’t pay to access the consumers they want (Web 2.0) and where consumers don’t come because they want to have fun, luxury brands would have to switch from a product brand to experience and product platform. Disclaimer: As of today, there is no certainty on the sustainability, diversity, and social benefit (e.g., rsk of increased sreen / VR time and social exclusion) of the metaverse. We believe all those factors are in the hands of the web3 builders, and can be solved, if the right attention and means are put in place.

Definition of main concepts

- Web3: Envisioned next version of the internet, decentralized and community driven (vs Web 2.0 which was centralized and social-driven) centered around user ownership and control, which follows Web 2.0 (in which users could read and create – reign of GAFA)
- Blockchain: Decentralized and immutable network which facilitates the process of recording transactions
- Crypto currency: Digital currency maintained by a decentralized system using blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc.)
- Non-Fungible Token: Unique token with provable ownership of the attached data – it can serve as a digital contract of authenticity and ownership (e.g., Bored Apes, Ticket pass, Art authentication certificate)
- Metaverse: Virtual, persistent, interactive worlds – they could exist both in Web2 (e.g., Roblox) or in Web3 (e.g., Decentraland, Sandbox)
- Augmented and Virtual Reality: Immersion in a virtually – rendered 3D world with physical cross over, usually accessible with VR headsets (e.g., Meta Oculus)

1. Web3 Revolutionizing the Relationship Between Brands And Consumers

The past year has seen no shortage of news flashes about metaverse breakthroughs and record-breaking NFT sales. Online game Fortnite saw its player count multiplied by seven over the past two years to reach more than 350 million registered users. The crypto and NFT boom has attracted a significant amount of capital and attention since early 2021, which is already making a tangible impact on several industries (e.g., digital art, gaming). After only 3 years of existence, NFT marketplace OpenSea reached a GMV of $14bn, i.e., 10 times bigger than StockX or twice the size of Sotheby’s. Proto-metaverse platform Sandbox raised over $500M through NFT sales and token emission and made 150 partnerships with brands, including Gucci. While the apostles of Web3 praise the emergence of blockchain-based technologies, this trend – like every new trend of this magnitude – does not come without a high degree of skepticism: crazy valuations, money laundering, insider trading, motion sickness with VR headsets, etc. However, just like with the Web 1.0 bubble, it’s necessary to sort out the signal from the noise. It would be a great mistake to limit Web3, Metaverse and NFTs to their parodical elements:

- NFTs should not be reduced to PFPs (profile pictures). They are a means towards community building.

Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), the most exclusive NFT collection, stands for much more than images of bored apes. It has become a way of expressing wealth, taste and belonging to a special community.

- Metaverse should not be reduced to VR specialists and VR should not be limited to currently available headsets. We define Metaverse as virtual, persistent, and social experiences. They can be Web 2.0 or Web3, with or without VR.

Exhibit 1. Archetypes of Metaverse

- * * * * * * * * * * * * * * One should also not discount longer trends and potential because there are strong underlying economic and cultural factors to believe in the development of Web3.
- Gaming is emerging as the new media and the winner of the attention war. With brands waging a relentless war of attention, the growth of content volume has outpaced available customer attention span. Add to this changes in privacy rules and a plateauing time spent in front of screens and you get skyrocketing online customer acquisition costs. The winner of this war is much likely to be social (not core) gaming, particularly with GenZ and Gen Alpha. Evidence of this lies in the fact that between 2019 and 2020, the time spent playing video games by 15-24-year-old U.S. residents increased by more than 50% and Roblox, a community-driven gaming platform, now counts more than 250 million active users.
- The public is shifting from passive to more active mode. Younger generations are more engaged in ESG topics and weary of governments and companies. They are wanting to play a part in the orchestration of their future. Knowledge has become a critical part of the luxury experience and audiences want to connect, learn and share.

- Web3 can change the way we see social media thanks to its anthropomorphic potential. Web3 has an inequivalent anthropomorphic potential. Digital economy and social codes are replicated virtually. Thanks to NFTs and blockchain technology, you can now both own digital assets, while also remaining within the same cultural code. In Web3, you are the owner of your data and journey; you no longer depend on Facebook or Google. It allows creation of new business models that don’t rely on data exploitation, creating stronger links with consumers. Sandbox or Decentraland have already cashed in several hundreds of millions through their token or by selling land, without having to sell any advertising.
- Combined, Metaverses, NFT and Web3 have the potential to transform the internet stacks. While attempts to challenge smartphone-based interface and Web 2.0 platforms have so far failed, spatial interfaces combined with Web3 authentication and payment could challenge current status quo established by dominant Web 2.0 platforms.

Exhibit 2. Web 1.0, 2.0 and Web3 stacks and vertical integrations

- * * * * * * * * * * * * * * The wave is still rising. Adoption for crypto and NFTs is still limited (300 million crypto holders worldwide or 8% of French population). Mass adoption is far away. All consumer sectors will be impacted, starting with media & entertainment, and followed by all sectors with large media budgets, high online sales, or high dependency on Web 2.0 platforms.

2. The Early Fit Between Web3 and Luxury And The Associated Opportunities For Brands The online world has so far only offered a challenging playground for luxury brands. Its undistinctive characteristics (short formats, codified, with fallen qualitative barriers to entry) made it very difficult for brands to offer a unique “touch and feel”. To date, luxury eCommerce has fallen short of meeting consumers’ expectations for luxury excellence (e.g., no significant effort to differentiate online experience or UX with non-

- 5-

luxury players) and omnichannel experience has proven to be better in mass (e.g., Zara) or other retail (e.g., Alibaba New Retail). Web3 is different:

- Blockchain is about privacy, authenticity, and scarcity. - NFTs are about demonstrating wealth, taste and belonging to a community. - Cryptocurrencies are a new concentration of ready-to-use financial capital. - Metaverse is about playful, immersive, and distinctive experiences.

There is an early fit between Web3 and luxury providing brands with opportunities in everything from inspiration to transaction and post-transaction service. Luxury brands could leverage Web3, NFTs and Metaverse to:

- Invent experiences from Inspiration to Transaction that are as differentiated as in real life, breaking free from codified Web 2.0 platforms and improving data privacy. Brands could regain trust from consumers and express their sophistication by creating exclusive and proprietary online experiences in virtual spaces, which brands would own without intermediaries, and by reintroducing privacy as a standard thanks to wallet-based identification and authentication certificates (NFTs).
- Create homogeneous ecosystems comparable to a virtual “Avenue Montaigne” through new metaverse platforms, offering a feeling of exclusivity and premium brand experiences in those virtual worlds (e.g., Sandbox creating premium districts for luxury brands, Garou metaverse platforms focusing on visuals quality). The opportunity for rich storytelling and experiences is significant. Brands could own dedicated online spaces in which they could virtually reproduce the exclusive events (e.g., fashion show) and shopping characteristics of the real world.
- Reinvent access and exclusivity through communities by leveraging NFTs as exclusive “access passes” for real world experience. Brands could control and personalize the distribution of such assets for members of their communities in order to further enhance both the exclusivity of assets and experiences and the proximity with communities. For brands, this return to earned media and community building is the cure for Web 2.0 domination over paid media.
- Reinvent customer relationship and loyalty. One key feature of the prevailing Web 2.0 growth-at-all- cost model of the last decade has been an increasing focus on speed of acquisition. However, as customer acquisition costs keep rising, funds must be increasingly directed towards brand building, retention, and deepening relationships. Web3 allows further increasing engagement and retention by leveraging NFTs and Metaverses to create new types of rewards (e.g., exclusive NFT drops) for customers and communities, new client service models and new forms of interactions with the brands’ codes (e.g., gamification for younger audiences).

This does not mean nor involve creating digital copies of physical products, the most widespread use case so far, which has been heavily commented by luxury executives and will represent a significant market opportunity for some brands. For brands who wouldn’t want to go that way, the list above shows there is still plenty to do leveraging blockchain-based technological features to further enhance the distinctive traits on which luxury brands have historically relied: scarcity, exclusivity, craftsmanship, storytelling and premiumization.

3. Initial Use Cases Are Great… But They’re Nothing Compared to What’s Coming The opening of this new version of the internet will come with a wide range of opportunities for brands and businesses across all sizes, geographies, industries, and business models. Identifying early on which use case will be applicable and most promising for each company will be key to succeeding in this new environment. In the short term, we believe that most promising business applications of Web3 will emerge across four key domains:

- Reach: Immersive brand awareness; virtual showroom in metaverse platforms. - Community engagement & Loyalty: virtual retail; Metaverse entertainment or service experience (e.g.,

Meta-contact center); community building. - Revenue and Business models: New digital products; branded NFTs; play-to-earn; pay-to-experience;

tokenization. - Process optimization: Authentication and traceability; AR/VR for improved operations (incl. store

associate training); secured and automated transactions. Up to now, the most interesting use cases in fashion and luxury include:

- Nike – Opened virtual world Nikeland in Roblox; a virtual world to play mini-games or find a collection of Nike products to personalize avatar looks (7M visitors in the past 4 months).
- Net-a-Porter, Givenchy – NAP created an island in Animal Crossing with Isabel Marant while Givenchy launched virtual versions of its most popular make-up product in the same universe.
- Louis Vuitton, Hugo Boss – Used NFTs as a tool to reward customers through a video game or a TikTok challenge (Louis the game downloaded by 200K+ users; Hugo Boss Tiktok challenge to win NFTs generated 7.5 billion views).
- Balenciaga – teamed up with Fortnite to unveil collaboration including shoppable virtual clothing and physical product
- D&G, Gucci – Are using NFTs to create and engage a new community with the DG family collection and the Gucci Rail collection (D&G sold $6M for their first NFT collection released, while Gucci made over $15M on the Rail collection).

Building on both those first use cases and the current trend, it is easy to imagine a set of new, groundbreaking initiatives flourishing in the coming years as technology improves:

- A second-hand luxury platform with royalties for creators / brands. - A worldwide inventory of high-end jewelry that can be easily showcased to all major clients around the

world without having to travel to Paris. - Scarcity and rarity of assets administrated and regulated by NFTs, always trackable for brands. - Wholesale brands becoming able to handle and engage their entire client community through NFTs

granting access to specific products lines or excludible assets. - Tiered loyalty programmes with innovative and gamified rewards (incl. metaverse experiences and

marketing to digital wallets), all the way to crypto payment through brand token - Launch of new brand and/or apparel through funding by communities and NFT-based pre-order setting

and ability to share outcomes (royalties and capital gains) with communities. - A metaverse multiplayer game of design where there is design, creativity, and competition and

maybe even the ability to purchase virtual and real-life product) - Metaverse luxury malls: new sales channels and virtual spaces where shoppers could engage with

one another, explore digital fashion items and enjoy an immersive experience.

4. Good News… The Same Recipe Still Applies: Test, Learn, Measure, Build an Ecosystem

Different winning strategies have been tried and tested to make brands succeed in Web 2.0. While some of them have decided to build their own virtual ecosystems, such as Nike or Starbucks, others chose to test early and iterate across multiple platforms. In both cases, experimentation took time but ended up achieving success. While each path is certainly different, we nonetheless believe that there will be overarching and immutable principles that will be mutual to all brands who are successful in their Web3 strategies:

- Screen time is more important than short-term ROI: companies need to invest to be in touch with their (future) clients, who are spending more and more time in metaverse platforms, before thinking about ROI, which will come afterwards.
- Test & Learn is the right philosophy: it will be a critical capability to adapting fast to a changing environment (platforms and associated rules) and “crack the code” for your business.
- Self-defined KPIs are critical to monitor performance: it allows measurement across platforms and circumvents the opacity and heterogeneity of KPIs defined by platforms.
- Progressively upskilling the organization is key: companies will always need to start by understanding their needs, relying on external partners to test and learn while progressively upskilling their workforce and internalize talents once business cases are clearer. Agencies also need to be pushed forward to keep up with the pace.
- Creating advisory Boards will be additive: given the speed at which this space is evolving establishing an advisory Board of “experts” who remain external to the company across regions and Web3 sub areas will be key to staying up to date, educating leaders and feeding the test-and-learn pipeline

Beyond those key principles, the state of the emerging Web3 market is still characterized by multiple challenges for luxury players: access to scarce resources for building, multiplicity of low-quality offers and competing metaverse platforms, lack of personal data to identify users and purchasers…

- * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Typology of Web3 required resources
- Experience Design: UX researcher, Game designer, Narrative designer, Game Economics conceptor - Coding Technology: Smart contract developer, Cybersecurity expert, Software development - 3D Technology : Voxel 3D designer, 3D artists, Motion designer - Community growth & engagement: Community managers, User acquisition, BI & Analytics
- * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Concretely, two different models of Web3 adoption have emerged for luxury brands:

- Immersive model: Best exemplified by Nike, which entered into Web3 by purchasing RKFT, the largest Web3-native design agency specialized in the design and drops of NFT collections.
- Test & learn model: Best exemplified by Kering, which has multiplied the initiatives to quickly learn and build a presence around the area of possibilities offered into Web3. This includes launching NFT collections with their own physical assets.
