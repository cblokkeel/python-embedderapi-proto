AI can benefit society in many ways but, given the energy needed to support the computing behind AI, these benefits can come at a high environmental price.

CodeCarbon is a lightweight software package that seamlessly integrates into your Python codebase. It estimates the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced by the cloud or personal computing resources used to execute the code.

It then shows developers how they can lessen emissions by optimizing their code or by hosting their cloud infrastructure in geographical regions that use renewable energy sources

## What it is

- 
    
    A lightweight and easy-to-use Python pip package
    
- 
    
    Emissions tracked based on your power consumption & location-dependent carbon intensity
    
- 
    
    Effective visualization of outputs in an integrated dashboard
    
- 
    
    Open-source, free, and driven by the community

### COMPUTING EMITS CO2. WE STARTED MEASURING HOW MUCH.

A single datacenter can consume large amounts of energy to run computing code. An innovative new tracking tool is designed to measure the climate impact of artificial intelligence.

## How it works

- [ Download the package](https://github.com/mlco2/code-carbon)
- [ Read the documentation](https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/)
- 
    
    Embed in your code with just a few lines of code
    
- 
    
    Run your code and let CodeCarbon track your emission
    
- 
    
    Visualize the output in clear dashboards
    

## Dashboard

### Visualizing the outputs & insights
