At BCG X. Ventures (formerly BCG Digital Ventures) we apply an end-to-end approach to build and launch standalone and new core businesses. We turn differentiated assets into strategic advantages that unlock growth, building everything needed—products and technology, business models and go-to-market strategies, and operations and organization foundations—to launch these projects at speed.

**Venture Architects at BCG X. Ventures**

Our venture architects are world-class business leaders, corporate strategists, product specialists, and designers. They carry the tall order of defining the field of opportunity and scope of our ventures and must wear many hats to develop the marketing, pricing, and operational structures needed to commercialize new products and businesses. As project leaders, they manage ventures from beginning to end, and may even transition to running these new businesses in the market.
