If there’s one thing European tech has no shortage of, it’s startup accelerators.

Every corner of the continent seems to have some — and today, for the first time, Sifted has compiled a database of more than 400 of them.

Accelerator programmes primarily offer a platform for first-time founders to gain advice, mentorship and financial support in the early days of their startup. Cohorts receive workshops, learning opportunities and, if they’re lucky, intros to relevant investors and mentors. They usually give the accelerators around 7% to 10% of their [equity](https://sifted.eu/articles/how-much-equity-early-stage-startup/) in exchange.

86% of Sifted readers who responded to our survey on accelerators told us they [would recommend the experience to others.](https://sifted.eu/articles/sifted-readers-startup-accelerators/)

However, not all of them get five star ratings: some Sifted readers said the “expert mentors” on their programme could have been a whole lot more expert. And, when we asked dozens of top tier VCs which accelerators they pay attention to, [only Entrepreneur First and Y Combinator](https://sifted.eu/articles/accelerators-european-vcs/) got more than a handful of votes.

There are, however, plenty of local and sector specialist accelerators playing a valuable role in boosting Europe’s startups. Here, we list more than 400 programmes submitted by Sifted readers and tidied up by Sifted analysts. If you think we’ve missed any, [let us know.](https://airtable.com/shrFg5aCvSq3RSU1f)
