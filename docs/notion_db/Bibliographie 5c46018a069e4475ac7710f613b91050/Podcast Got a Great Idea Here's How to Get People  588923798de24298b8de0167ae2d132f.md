You aren’t paying enough attention to “friction,” according to Kellogg professors [Loran Nordgren](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/nordgren_loran.aspx) and [David Schonthal](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/schonthal_david.aspx), who authored the upcoming book *[The Human Element: Overcoming the Resistance That Awaits New Ideas.](http://kell.gg/qbz)* Frictions, they say, are the sticking points that make people less likely to adopt something new.

On this episode of The Insightful Leader, Nordgren—a professor of management and organizations—and Schonthal—a clinical professor of innovation and entrepreneurship—explain how to overcome the four types of frictions that get in the way of change.
