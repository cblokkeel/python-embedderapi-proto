Sodium-ion batteries are going to be a major disruption to the lithium-ion battery industry.

Sodium-ion batteries product performance indicators are comparable, its working principal "rocking chair battery" is similar (i.e. switching over existing LIB production lines over to sodium-ion batteries is timely and inexpensive) and raw materials are abundant in resources, location, and inexpensive.

In terms of the material system, except for the separator, all other base materials used in sodium-ion batteries are different, especially the cathode material and anode material.

- Cathode: since sodium ions have a larger radius than lithium ions, it is difficult for them to intercalate making for poor energy density, therefore the cathode material types used today in sodium-ion batteries are namely layered transition metal oxides, polyanionic compounds or Prussian blue compounds.
- Anode: graphite-based anode material used in lithium-ion batteries cannot effectively intercalate sodium ions, therefore, the anode material used in sodium-ion batteries today is generally amorphous carbon-based material products such as hard carbon or soft carbon.
- Electrolyte: the molar conductivity of sodium ions is higher, which makes the concentration of electrolyte required for sodium-ion batteries lower, and the requirements for additives also lower. Today sodium hexafluorophosphate is used in sodium ion batteries.
- Separator: sodium-ion batteries use polyethylene (“PE”) or polypropylene (“PP”) as separator material, which is the same as lithium-ion batteries, there is no difference.
- Current collectors: both the cathode current collector and anode current collector of sodium-ion batteries use aluminium foil, while lithium-ion batteries use aluminium foil for cathode current collector and copper foil for anode current collector.

In terms of product performance, sodium-ion batteries advantages include good safety, rate performance, and low temperature performance, but have the disadvantages of poor cycle life and its energy density is comparable to only that of conventional lithium iron phosphate batteries.

Due to the comparable energy density, excellent rate performance and significant cost advantage of sodium-ion batteries, they are considered cost-effective and will be applied to large-scale energy storage systems, two-wheeler electric vehicles and low-speed electric vehicles and are expected to complement and eventually replace lithium-ion batteries in the future. Large-scale energy storage systems mainly include wind power plants, solar power plants and household energy storage systems while low-speed electric vehicles mainly include logistics vehicles, agricultural vehicles, electric vehicles, electric buses and electric boats.

Next-generation sodium-ion batteries will compete against high-performance ternary batteries used in electric vehicles.
