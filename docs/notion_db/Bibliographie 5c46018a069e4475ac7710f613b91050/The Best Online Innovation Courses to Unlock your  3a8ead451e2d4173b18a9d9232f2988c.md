Innovation is the catalyst for business growth, yet many companies have a hard time innovating. There are multiple factors contributing to successful innovation in a corporate context, but why exactly is it so hard to get innovation right? We’d argue that a skilled workforce plays a big role in this equation.

Innovation might be difficult, but it’s not impossible. It takes a set of skills, all of which you can learn and get better at. Today, we’ll explore these skills and tell how leaders, managers and experts can learn or further develop them. We’ll also share the best resources to learn more about the topic, including a list of the best online innovation courses out there. But before we get there, let’s take a step back and see what it takes to be good at innovation.

![The%20Best%20Online%20Innovation%20Courses%20to%20Unlock%20your%20%203a8ead451e2d4173b18a9d9232f2988c/online20innovation20courses.jpg](The%20Best%20Online%20Innovation%20Courses%20to%20Unlock%20your%20%203a8ead451e2d4173b18a9d9232f2988c/online20innovation20courses.jpg)

As the importance and appreciation of innovation has recently become even more important, there’s been a huge influx of tools to help in different parts of this process. These tools can be a tremendous asset to help individuals and companies get the most out of their ideas.

### Skills top innovation courses and training should help you develop

When speaking about the skills required to make innovation to happen, creativity, curiosity, hunger to learn, and adaptability always come up. In our article about [what is an innovation manager](https://www.viima.com/blog/innovation-manager), we went through the variety of skills necessary to succeed at innovation and those that set great innovators apart. These include things like omniscience, leadership, entrepreneurial spirit and mental toughness.

As a manager or a leader, you probably have already developed many of these skills. If you’re reading this, you are probably also hungry and curious to learn more. But if you want to become a top-notch innovator and build an innovation engine for your organization, you might also want to work on the following skills.

![The%20Best%20Online%20Innovation%20Courses%20to%20Unlock%20your%20%203a8ead451e2d4173b18a9d9232f2988c/udemy20top20innovation20courses.jpg](The%20Best%20Online%20Innovation%20Courses%20to%20Unlock%20your%20%203a8ead451e2d4173b18a9d9232f2988c/udemy20top20innovation20courses.jpg)

### 1. Understanding innovation

The complexity of the topic requires leaders to have a firm understanding of what innovation is, how it works in theory, and more importantly, in practice. To get there, you can just try it all out yourself and see what works, but it’s also a good idea to accelerate that progress by looking at the research and how other leaders and organizations are approaching innovation.

For example, you should be familiar with the key [innovation management models and theories](https://www.viima.com/blog/innovation-management-models). This will give you a wider view on all the different [types of innovation](https://www.viima.com/blog/types-of-innovation) which will make it easier for you to identify how your organization should approach innovation. Understanding the core concepts, such as [innovation processes](https://www.viima.com/blog/innovation-management-processes) can help you avoid simple mistakes and provide a more structured approach to innovation.

The best innovation courses will take you through the theory but will also put emphasis on the practical aspects. When choosing a course, it’s good to be aware of your current areas of expertise and level of knowledge so that you know what your focus should be within innovation. If you don’t feel that you are well-versed on most of these topics, you might want to start with an innovation course aimed for beginners.

### 2. Strategic thinking skills

Strategic thinking skills are essential in achieving business objectives and addressing challenges. They enable us to use our critical thinking to solve complex problems and plan for the future.

Under the strategic thinking umbrella, we include analytical skills, communication skills, problem solving skills and planning and management skills. Obviously, this is not something you learn in a week or a month. They can all be learned and sharpened throughout our lives so leaders should continuously work to improve these skills if they want to become better at innovation.

Strategic thinking is developed when we learn what questions to ask, how to be self-critical, how to observe and reflect and how to be open to opposing ideas. Training can naturally help develop such skills, and you can find at least one innovation course that supports strategic thinking in the list below.

### 3. Leadership skills

![The%20Best%20Online%20Innovation%20Courses%20to%20Unlock%20your%20%203a8ead451e2d4173b18a9d9232f2988c/skill20development.jpg](The%20Best%20Online%20Innovation%20Courses%20to%20Unlock%20your%20%203a8ead451e2d4173b18a9d9232f2988c/skill20development.jpg)

Great leaders inspire and empower others to make better, smarter decisions. But there is leadership and then there is innovation leadership. The best innovation leaders are not just empathic communicators and creative strategic thinkers.

They also have to be agile to navigate constantly changing environments, bold to take informed risks, and open to embrace uncertainty. With all of this complexity and uncertainty, strong communication is needed to make sure their team understands the situation and is onboard.

There are innovation leadership programs tailored for organizations that want to invest in developing their leaders, like the one from [Board of Innovation](https://www.boardofinnovation.com/talent/innovation-leadership/).

### 4. Risk assessment and risk-taking skills

When speaking about innovation, risk assessment and risk taking come with the territory. There is more risk in doing innovation than in normal business but there is even a bigger risk of going out of business if you don’t take any risks. Risks always come with uncertainty, so you have to learn to live with that and choose when and [how to take smart, educated risks with incomplete information.](https://www.viima.com/blog/risk-and-luck-in-innovation)

Leaders who encourage risk taking have to embrace failure because it is part of the learning process and is inevitable when dealing with difficult problems. This helps increase [the pace of innovation.](https://www.viima.com/blog/pace-of-innovation)

### 5. Creativity and empathy

For today’s innovation leaders to succeed, empathy is crucial. Learn to listen so you can relate to employees and customers. Great innovation occurs when people’s needs, and struggles are understood. This is how empathy can also be a great fuel for creativity.

> **In reality, creativity is a learning habit that requires specific skills.**
> 

We already brought up creativity as one of the necessary skills for innovation to happen. Considering that [69% of people](https://www.steelcase.com/research/articles/topics/workplace/bring-brilliance-making-great-ideas/) don’t believe they can live up to their full creative potential, we can see how this can become a huge barrier for organizations trying to innovate. Creativity has been long seen as a matter of talent. You either have it or you don’t. In reality, creativity is a learning habit that requires specific skills.

Acting with “[flexibility, intelligence and novelty](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/Images/426483-chapter-4-innovation-and-creativity.pdf)” as well as having the knowledge to think creatively are important skills that can be nurtured and developed. Creative teams can still fail at innovation, so as [we’ve previously pointed out](https://www.viima.com/blog/why-do-large-organizations-with-creative-people-fail-in-innovation), structures, processes and tools all play a big role in helping creative people innovate successfully.

### How to choose the right innovation management course for you

Innovation can be hard to grasp at first, especially when it comes to putting the theory into practice. Some innovation courses are great at getting you on track by explaining the basics. These beginners’ courses can also help you avoid common mistakes that many innovation leaders have made before you.

You know by now that great innovators have a growth mindset and an insatiable curiosity and hunger to learn more. It’s only natural that they develop their skills also through training and continuous learning. With the large number of available resources out there it’s easy to get lost in all the noise. So, what are the ingredients of a great innovation course and what should you look out for when choosing one?

- 
    
    ### Emphasis on new perspectives
    

Even if you think you are knowledgeable in innovation there is always so much more to learn as this is a very dynamic topic in a continuously changing environment. The more you learn about a topic, the more you realize how much you still don’t know.

Ideally, your course of choice should bring a new perspective on knowledge you’re already somewhat familiar with. A fresh approach and new angles will help you uncover new opportunities and solutions. These new perspectives will also help you question your assumptions and think more critically about how your organization has been approaching innovation.

- 
    
    ### Highly practical
    

Theory is useful, but it won’t get you too far in the real world. To become a truly great innovator, you need to know how to put theory into practice. Rote learning can be useful to develop foundational knowledge but unless you’re trying to apply that knowledge for yourself, you won’t be creating any innovations. Focus on practical courses that provide good insights into theories but also make you think, force you to be disciplined and lead you through the process of planning and implementing innovation. That’s when you’ll see tangible results.

- 
    
    ### Additional resources
    

A good innovation course shouldn’t just feed your curiosity but they’re all likely to raise new questions and encourage you to challenge your own thinking. Taking an innovation course is not the end of the journey, it’s just a stage you go through. The best innovation courses should provide additional resources like tools, articles, research papers, books that can deepen your knowledge.

### The top 8 innovation management courses

As mentioned, there’s a wide variety of online resources to get you started on innovation, or to help you refine your knowledge and skills. This makes it even harder to choose one that suits your needs. Some might be too abstract and theoretical; some might only scratch the surface without providing in-depth information that adds real value.

We went through most of these courses and ended up picking eight that we believe can best contribute to your growth and development as an innovator. This is not meant to be a to do list that you must go through one by one, so choose whatever fits your specific situation and needs.

### Additional resources for learning about innovation management

As we’ve covered, good courses (be they online or offline) can be a great way to take your expertise to the next level. Just keep in mind that to continuously keep getting better, you need to stay curious, keep informed, follow the best and most reliable experts and sources on the topic that can help you stay on top of it all.

Also, keep in mind that accumulating knowledge is just one side of the coin. The other is to test what you learn and apply it in practice. So, experiment and see how these innovation theories could be applied in your specific case. This way you can start tweaking methods and processes to find your own recipe for innovation success.

Having said that, here’s an additional list of innovation resources you might find useful. This is by no means an exhaustive list, as it can quickly become overwhelming, but we’ve listed some of the ones we find to be the most inspiring and insightful.

### Conclusion

No leader can build an innovation engine in their organization without being well-versed on the subject of innovation. Organizations that succeed at innovation have a strategic perspective and a long-time future oriented vision. This approach is enabled by people who can generate and apply new knowledge and ideas in order to build the right environment for innovation to flourish in.

Great innovators don’t just have great ideas. One of the things that sets great innovators apart is how they position themselves on top of their industry, they understand innovation and keep up with the latest theories, trends and new ideas on the topic.

Knowing how to actually implement innovation based on strategies and smart processes is hardly a talent you’re born with. Some may have a knack for innovation, but it still comes down to nurturing that talent with perseverance, dedication and hard work to develop the right skills. So stay hungry for knowledge and curious about innovation and you’re on your way to reach greatness.
