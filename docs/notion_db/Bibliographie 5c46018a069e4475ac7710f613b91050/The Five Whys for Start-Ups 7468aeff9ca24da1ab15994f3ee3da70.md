Root cause analysis and preventive maintenance are concepts we expect to see in a factory setting. Start-ups supposedly don’t have time for detailed processes and procedures. And yet [the key to startup speed](https://hbr.org/cs/2010/03/the_startups_rules_of_speed.html) is to maintain [a disciplined approach to testing and evaluating](https://hbr.org/cs/2010/02/how_much_process_is_too_much.html) new products, features, and ideas. As start-ups scale, this agility will be lost unless the founders maintain a consistent investment in that discipline. Techniques from lean manufacturing can be part of a startup’s innovation culture.

One such technique is called Five Whys, which has its origins in the Toyota Production System, and posits that behind every supposedly technical problem is actually a human problem. Applied to a start-up, here’s how it works:

1. A new release broke a key feature for customers. Why? Because a particular server failed.
2. Why did the server fail? Because an obscure subsystem was used in the wrong way.
3. Why was it used in the wrong way? The engineer who used it didn’t know how to use it properly.
4. Why didn’t he know? Because he was never trained.
5. Why wasn’t he trained? Because his manager doesn’t believe in training new engineers, because they are “too busy.”

What began as a purely technical fault is quickly revealed to be a very human managerial issue. Traditional TPS would emphasize fixing the root cause, but I advocate a slightly different approach. It calls for making a proportional investment at each of the five levels of the hierarchy. In other words, fix the server, change the subsystem to make it less error-prone, educate the engineer, and yes, have a conversation with their manager.

That conversation is always hard, especially in a start-up. When I was a manager, if you’d told me I needed to invest in a training process, I would have told you that it would be a waste of time. In order to avoid it, I’d probably have said something like “sure, I’d be happy to do that — if you can spare my time for the eight weeks it’ll take to set up.”

That’s where the proportional investment tactic is so important. If this outage was a minor problem, it’s essential that we make only a minor investment. Perhaps a skeptical manager could do the first hour of the eight-week plan? That doesn’t sound like much, but it’s a start. If the problem recurs, five why’s will keep insisting we make progress on it. And, if not, the hour isn’t a big loss.

I used the engineering training example because that’s, in fact, the thing I was reluctant to invest in at my last start-up. At the outset of that venture, I would’ve laughed at the idea that a startup could afford it. And yet, after countless five whys turned up problems in training, we eventually created a rigorous training program. It was so good, we could get a new engineer productive on their very first day of work. At no point did we stop everything and invest in training. Instead, we constantly made incremental improvements to our process, each time reaping incremental benefit. Over time, these changes compound, freeing up substantial time and energy that was previously being lost to fire-fighting and crisis management.

This is especially important in a start-up, because the constant chaos and confrontation of unknowns leads to plenty of fire-fighting. If the overhead of dealing with those unknowns grows proportionally, it can drain an innovative team of the time and energy necessary to make those courageous changes in direction known as pivots. Lean start-up techniques like the Five Whys prevent entrepreneurial teams from going too fast. Yes, start-ups are all about speed. And startups that act without discipline can go faster, just like a driver can go faster with eyes closed and a maxed-out accelerator. Being in motion is not intrinsically worthwhile. Start-ups need to maximize their [speed measured in validated learning](https://hbr.org/cs/2010/02/entrepreneurs_beware_of_vanity_metrics.html) and not just tasks accomplished or energy expended.

Lean start-up techniques like the Five Whys act as a natural speed regulator. If teams are going too fast to maintain their discipline, regular root cause analysis meetings force the team to automatically invest in some prevention. The more problems, the more prevention. As these prevention investments pay off, the rate of crises goes down, and the team can speed up again. And to tie the rate of progress to learning, not just execution, startup teams can do Five Whys whenever they encounter any kind of failure — including failures to achieve business results, change customer behavior, or even the failure of a proposed business model.

In fact, it’s this last case that is truly fundamental to building a lean start-up. Every business plan is provisional. When reality doesn’t seem willing to accommodate the founders’ vision, it’s time for the most important decision a start-up can face: pivot or persevere? Figuring out when to do which is the subject of the next post in this series.
