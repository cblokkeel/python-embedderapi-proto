For the last three years I have been documenting my journey learning the craft of venture capital. How the “people on the other side of the table” think can be such a mystery to founders. Both sides work in tech but are pretty different in their motivations, concerns and mental models. I have recently jumped into an operating role in one of my portfolio companies and now see the journey from the founder perspective. Here are some of the big differences

**High amplitude**

The ups and downs of life in a start-up are intense. I had some bad days in VC but I could always see them coming (tuesdays..). In start-up land I am amazed at how I can go from a sense of impending failure to a belief in world domination on a seemingly random but high amplitude cadence. Greg O’Grady told me that founders just feel ups and downs more deeply and he was right. It’s such a roller coaster.

**Chicken vs Pig Commitment**

While a VC I had at least one company that ran out of cash. I was a diligent director, working the issues, trying to get a good outcome for employees and shareholders. But I did not feel those crises in the same way as being on the founder side. Here I literally am awake at night worried about cashflow. It’s the difference in commitment when making an omelette to bringing the ham instead of the eggs.

**Teams vs partnerships**

As a VC you are in a partnership. That may sound intimate but actually VCs are often lone wolves, out hunting for deals and looking after their specific portfolio companies. You are bound together with the other partners under a legal structure and set of common processes, but as with many service oriented partnerships, you are largely managing your own book of business. At start-ups there is just a much deeper sense of intimacy and connectedness. We talk multiple times a day, we know when each other are worried, we share hotel rooms and sleep in each other’s houses. It’s just a different level of bond.

**For-Real Missions**

At my start-up our mission is our reason for being. It’s instantiated in everything we do: hiring, prioritization, product roadmaps, how we make decisions etc etc. VCs may say they have a mission but really they are financial institutions whose job is to deliver high returns for shareholders. No shame in that, it is people’s retirement savings after all. Mission statements in most VCs are more about branding than they are deeply interwoven into daily actions. There are a few exceptions I have seen but it’s largely an out-take of being in the financial services industry that mission statements are secondary to targeted returns.

**Construction vs Surveying**

VCs are like construction surveyors — we map the landscape, measure contours and plan where the biggest buildings might have their strongest footing. It a deeply analytical craft and an important one to do well to ensure a strong portfolio that generates returns. But we don’t actually get to build anything new ourselves. At my start-up we have a whole roadmap of things we get to invent and launch. It more like being in construction where at the end of the day you can point at something that was not there the day before and, hopefully, real people get to use and enjoy.

Both jobs are great, both have their positives and minuses. But it is really nice to spend some time on the founder side for a while. Thanks so much kry10 for having me on board.
