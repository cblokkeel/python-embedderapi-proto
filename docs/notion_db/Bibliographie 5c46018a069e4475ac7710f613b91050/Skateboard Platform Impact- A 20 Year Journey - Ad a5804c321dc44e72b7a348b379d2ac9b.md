Reinventing the Automobile Program

## Disruption

The impact of the [Reinvention of the Automobile](http://www.adrianchernoff.com/project/reinventing-the-automobile/) with the creation of the first Electric Skateboard Platform at General Motors has had a profound and rippling effect on the entire automotive industry. When the General Motors [AUTOnomy](http://www.adrianchernoff.com/project/autonomy/) was revealed to the world in 2001 it was called “the car of the future” by the New York Times and Economist. Elizabeth Kohlbert from the New Yorker said, “Outside of science fiction” … The [AUTOnomy](http://www.adrianchernoff.com/project/autonomy/) is “the most radical reinvention of the automobile that has ever been imagined … it can even serve as a source of electricity … it does not merely improve on something that exists but vaults over all possible improvement to achieve something totally new.” Adrian Chernoff, the Chief Creative Engineer and [inventor of the skateboard platform](http://www.adrianchernoff.com/bio/) said in the New York Times, “‘This is like a blank canvas, and you can paint whatever you want on top.’’ And David Cole from the Center of Automotive Research called it “the biggest thing to happen in the last 50 years in transportation.”

## Industry Adoption of the Electric Skateboard Platform

Almost every automotive manufacturer beginning with Tesla, aspiring vehicle start-ups like Rivian and Nueron, and VW who is investing $30B in the similar MEB platform are utilizing the creations, inventions and forward-thinking innovations of the [Reinvention of the Automobile](http://www.adrianchernoff.com/project/reinventing-the-automobile/) Program that enables the future of self-driving, autonomous assisted and autonomous vehicles. Building on this legacy of automotive transformation, accelerating vehicle electrification and digitization, many automotive companies have copied, built-upon and leveraged the modular car concepts and skateboard electric vehicle platform with batteries, hydrogen fuel cells, internal combustion’s engines are any combination thereof with its flexible, adaptable and customizable architecture. Here is a chronological history of what’s been happening starting with the most recent developments and vehicle deliveries.

### General Motors

GM announced a new EV architecture and battery solution called Ultium. As GM works to reinvent the company for an EV future, the Ultium platform will enable a flexible global platform and an all-electric future powered by the batteries. With Ultium energy, and tagged under “Our Electric Future is Now”, the battery technology has a range up to 400 miles and allows for zero to 60 mph acceleration in as low as 60 seconds. Ultium supports front, rear, and all-wheel drive applications.

After an investment by Ford Motor Company into Rivian of $500M in April of 2019, the investments first payoff will come with in the form of the Lincoln Electric SUV. Rivian’s flexible skateboard platform and architecture is a key part of Ford’s all-new vehicle line-up and investment of $11.5 billion into electrification. Future electrified vehicles include the F-150 pickup and the Mustang Mach-E.
