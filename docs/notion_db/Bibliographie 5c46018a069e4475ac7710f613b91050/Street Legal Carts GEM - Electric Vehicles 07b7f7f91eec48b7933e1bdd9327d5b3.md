Golf carts are not designed to exceed 15 mph (24 km/h) and do not have the safety features required for use on public roads. Street-legal carts, however, are equipped with safety features for on-road driving.

Yes. GEM is the leader in the LSV (Low-Speed Vehicle) market, and GEM vehicles are street-legal in 47 states. An LSV is a vehicle class that has a maximum speed of 25 mph (40 km/h), and can legally be driven on most roads posted 35 mph (50 km/h) or less.

While it may seem like a golf cart, GEM has many additional features that make it so much more. GEM is equipped with safety features required to be classified as a low-speed vehicle, and some of our features go above and beyond the standard LSV requirements. For example, GEM vehicles are roof crush certified to SAE J2358 standards. It is also designed to with premium rider comfort and experience in mind.
