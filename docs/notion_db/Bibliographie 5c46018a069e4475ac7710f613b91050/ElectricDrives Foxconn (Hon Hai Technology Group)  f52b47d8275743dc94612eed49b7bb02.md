Hon Hai Technology Group (HHTG), which is known internationally as [Foxconn](https://electricdrives.tv/ev-biz/iphone-producer-foxconn-set-to-beat-apple-to-market-by-manufacturing-electric-vehicles-ev-in-thailand-with-battery-producer-ptt-plc/), have announced two new self-developed concept prototype [electric vehicles (EVs)](https://electricdrives.tv/ev-life/best-reasons-to-drive-an-electric-car-2/) at its third annual Hon Hai Tech Day (HHTD). These electric cars, which will join the brand’s MODEL C, include the MODEL B, a hatchback [electric crossover,](https://electricdrives.tv/ev-life/best-crossover-electric-cars/) and the MODEL V, an all-terrain [electric pickup](https://electricdrives.tv/ev-life/best-electric-trucks-that-are-on-the-way-with-videos/).

Foxconn, which produces the Apple iPhone, are the world’s largest technology manufacturer and service provider and are looking to [move into the electric vehicle space](https://electricdrives.tv/ev-biz/foxconn-sets-its-sights-on-making-electric-cars-in-europe-india-and-latin-america/) in a big way.

They recently announced a collaboration to build [Monarch electric tractors](https://electricdrives.tv/ev-biz/foxconn-and-monarch-tractor-to-build-next-generation-electric-tractors-and-battery-packs/) at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio in the US. Plus they will be [working with Fisker](https://electricdrives.tv/ev-biz/fisker-and-foxconn-announce-new-fisker-pear-electric-vehicle-ev-will-be-produced-in-ohio-usa/) to produce its Pear electric car at the same plant.

Alongside the two new vehicles mentioned, Foxconn also showcased its production vehicle MODEL C which will be delivered to its customers in Taiwan next year.

At HHTD the company also presented key components of the EV supply chain, such as its electric power steering (EPS) system, solid-state battery, silicon carbide power module and semiconductors. **In addition, this year’s HHTD promoted the business model of contract design and manufacturing service (CDMS) in the field of electric vehicles through the next decade**.

**MODEL C**

The MODEL C is Taiwan’s first electric vehicle to go into production. It’s built on Foxconn’s MIH open platform and has gone directly from last year’s concept prototype to this year’s production vehicle. This demonstrates Hon Hai’s impressive automotive manufacturing capabilities.

It has a modern aerodynamic shape with a drag coefficient of 0.28. and will offer a range of up 435 miles (700km). It’s also an impressive mover hitting 0-62mph (0-100kph) in just 3.8 seconds. The production version of the MODEL C is anticipated to hit the roads in Taiwan in the second half of 2023.

**MODEL B**

The new MODEL B is an urban crossover aimed at the younger generation. It is based on the MODEL C platform but with changes to the platform size and a new body design.

Its S-duct design, streamlined roof and innovative air curtain on the D-pillar greatly reduce air turbulence. This allows the MODEL B to achieve an excellent drag coefficient of 0.26. The compact 4.3m MODEL B has a cruising range of 280 miles (450km) and uses a 2.8m wheelbase to create a comfortable, roomy cockpit.

**MODEL V**

The new MODEL V is Taiwan’s first designed and self-developed electric pickup and is the result of the vertical integration of Hon Hai and MIH alliance partners. With a payload of up to one ton and a towing capacity of three tons, its performance has the ability to traverse all terrains.

This EV pickup adopts a double-cab with a five-seat configuration. Sensors surrounding the body are combined with electronic rearview mirrors and a display screen to integrate the instrument panel. This not only improves safety but offers intelligent technology to users.

Young Liu, Hon Hai chairman and CEO, said: “Hon Hai’s vision has always been to produce complete solutions to bellwether customers and provide for comprehensive intelligent lifestyles.

> “We used to make PCs and mobile phones. From now and into the future, we will create EVs. For more than 40 years, the greatest value we have brought to top-tier, global brand customers is that Hon Hai is your most trusted and reliable partner.

“In the EV industry, we are resolute about CDMS: This means contract design and manufacturing service. This commitment will not change. In the next 10 years, Hon Hai in the EV industry will redefine CDMS in the automotive field and continue to promote vertically integrated technology services.

**“Our goal is to provide the range of high-tech services and capabilities required by automakers to propel them to become more competitive.”**
