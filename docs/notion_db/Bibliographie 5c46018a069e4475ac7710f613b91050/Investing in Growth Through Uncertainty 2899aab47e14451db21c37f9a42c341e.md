Summary.

When faced with disruptions and downturns, many leaders and companies instinctively focus on cutting costs to maintain profitability. But some identify opportunities and then take thoughtful action to emerge from crisis even stronger. That means not only planning for worst-case scenarios and pressure-testing operational and financial health but also staying alert for ways to find a winning edge and making needed investments. Those leaders do so by fostering three mindsets: *sensemaking in crisis, a bootstrap ethic,* and *stakeholder balance.* Examples from Alaska Airlines, Firefly, Panera Bread, and Edward Jones show how this works in practice. Leaders who embrace these ways of thinking can chart a course for the future even when the outlook is darkest.

In early 2020 the pandemic plunged the airline industry into crisis, as passenger traffic on [U.S. carriers plummeted 96%](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-104429#:~:text=The%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic%20had,shops%2C%20and%20the%20supply%20chain) on a year-over-year basis. Like many of its peers, Alaska Airlines responded by quickly moving to stabilize its finances. It implemented a hiring freeze, cut senior managers’ salaries, renegotiated payment terms with vendors, suspended stock repurchases and dividend payments, and reduced capital spending. But the company also did something that set it apart. As competitors canceled airplane orders, Alaska Airlines’ leaders spotted an opportunity to update and expand the company’s fleet at attractive prices while streamlining operations by shifting from a mix of Airbus and Boeing aircraft to only Boeing. Confident that its balance sheet was strong, the company announced in December 2020 that it had agreed to buy 68 Boeing planes, with an option to buy 52 more. It was the only major U.S. airline to place a large aircraft order that year. “We wanted to be aggressive to enable our recovery coming out of the huge challenges of the pandemic,” then-president and current CEO Ben Minicucci explains. “We knew supply chain issues would hamper airplane deliveries, but this deal would put us first in line and set us up nicely to expand.” After all, “you can’t grow in this business without airplanes.”
